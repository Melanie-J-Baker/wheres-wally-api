# wheres-wally-api

Where's Wally API created using Express and MongoDB, as part of the Odin Project curriculum (also see frontend repository (React) at: github.com/Melanie-J-Baker/wheres-wally).

Try it here: https://main--wheres-wally.netlify.app/

Very similar to a photo tagging app. A large photograph containing several elements the user is meant to find, e.g. Waldo, The Wizard, Wilma etc. User can make selections for each character and they will be given feedback on whether they are correct or not.

When the user clicks the photo, app checks with backend to see if that character is within the targeting box. Provides user with appropriate feedback (e.g. if wrong, an error message). Once a round is complete, asks the user for their name and records time taken.

See frontend repo for screenshots of app: github.com/Melanie-J-Baker/wheres-wally
